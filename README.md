# Convolutional Neural Network

To run the program
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python cnnTF.py

```

## 3 different convolutional models have been implemented.

1.
- 7x7 Conv with stride 2
- Relu activation
- Fully connected that map to 10 output classes

Since I have a MAC book without GPU this entire program takes a long time to run (about 8-9 hours).
